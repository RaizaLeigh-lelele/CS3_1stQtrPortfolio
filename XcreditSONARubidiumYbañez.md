❓ <b>Kabit Kuryente Until 2028</b> – it might be temporary solutions for electricity, but it sounds unsafe or not sustainable.<br><br>
❓ <b>Car-Free Sundays Nationwide</b> – while it sounds nice, it might not work well in places where public transportation isn’t reliable yet.

<h2 style="color:#689f38;">💬 Write 2 paragraphs of reflection</h2>

The SONA 2025 focused heavily on social services, education, and job creation, which shows an obvious attempt to reach the everyday Filipino. I was very interested in the investment in education — free WiFi, learning materials, and counseling for mental health show that the government is starting to finally understand what students truly need. The plans for free college and expanded Tech-Voc are promising because they open up to much more career paths. I appreciated the focus on public school teachers, giving them tools like laptops, overtime pay, and fewer paperwork requirements.<br><br>

However, while the promises are big, I wonder how much of it will really happen. It's easy to list projects, but harder to execute them well. Some areas like energy and internet access have been talked about in many past SONAs too, but many people still struggle with them. I think what matters most is accountability — seeing results, not just hearing about them. If the plans are followed through, then this could be a hugeeee turning point for this country.
