<h2 style="color:#1976d2;">Topics I Know Very Well</h2>
<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #e3f2fd, #bbdefb); padding: 15px; border-left: 6px solid #42a5f5; border-radius: 10px; font-family:'Segoe UI'; color:#0d47a1;">

1. <b>For Loops</b> – I understand how to use for loops to repeat a block of code a set number of times. This is helpful when I need to display a list of numbers or repeat actions without writing the same code multiple times.<br><br>

2. <b>If–Else Statements</b> – Conditionals are one of the topics I am very confident with. I know how to use if, else if, and else to make the program respond differently depending on the conditions.<br><br>

3. <b>JavaScript Buttons</b> – I know how to connect HTML buttons to JavaScript functions so they perform actions when clicked. For example, a button can display text, change colors, or show an alert.<br><br>

4. <b>Do–While Loops</b> – I clearly understand that a do–while loop will always run at least once before checking the condition. This is useful in cases like asking for user input and continuing until the input is valid.<br><br>

5. <b>Arithmetic Operators</b> – I understand how to use arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, /, and % in JavaScript. These allow me to perform calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding remainders.

<h2 style="color:#ef6c00;">Topics I Know But Need More Practice</h2>
<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3e0, #ffe0b2); padding: 15px; border-left: 6px solid #fb8c00; border-radius: 10px; font-family:'Segoe UI'; color:#e65100;">

1. <b>Nested Loops</b> – I know what nested loops are and how they work. However, I still get confused when keeping track of variables inside the multiple loops. It becomes more difficult when solving patterns or tables.<br><br>

2. <b>Functions in JavaScript</b> – I understand the purpose of functions but I forget how to pass arguments and return values properly. I sometimes write longer code instead of reusing functions.<br><br>

3. <b>CSS Backgrounds and Opacity</b> – I know CSS can change the background color, images, and opacity of a webpage. But I have trouble controlling the opacity because it also affects the text inside the element. I also get confused when I try to make backgrounds look neat with images or gradients.<br><br>

4. <b>Arrays</b> – I know arrays are used to store multiple values in one variable. However, I sometimes make mistakes when looping through them or accessing indexes. It can be confusing when I forget where the first element starts.<br><br>

5. <b>Variables and Data Types</b> – I know that variables store information and that there are data types like numbers, strings, and booleans. But I sometimes forget when to use quotation marks or how to combine different data types. This makes my code show errors or unexpected results.

<h2 style="color:#689f38;">Plan of Action</h2>
<div style="background: linear-gradient(to right, #f1f8e9, #dcedc8); padding: 15px; border-left: 6px solid #9ccc65; border-radius: 10px; font-family:'Segoe UI'; color:#33691e;">

- For <b>Nested Loops</b>, I will solve more problems involving patterns and grids. Practicing these will help me see how inner and outer loops interact. I will also study examples step by step to understand the flow.<br><br>

- For <b>Functions</b>, I will create small programs that require parameters and return values. I will practice writing simple functions until I can do it without mistakes. I will also review examples from class to reinforce what I learned.<br><br>

- For <b>CSS Backgrounds and Opacity</b>, I will test different CSS properties like opacity, rgba(), and background images. I will try small projects like adding transparent boxes or gradient backgrounds.<br><br>

- For <b>Arrays</b>, I will review how to loop through them using for and for...of. I will practice storing and displaying values to understand how indexes work. By repeating exercises and more, I can avoid simple mistakes.<br><br>

- For <b>Variables and Data Types</b>, I will write examples using numbers, strings, and booleans. I will practice combining them and checking what results I get.

<h2 style="color:#ad1457;">Effective and Not Effective Activities</h2>
<div style="background: #fce4ec; padding: 15px; border-left: 6px solid #d81b60; border-radius: 10px; font-family:'Segoe UI'; color:#880e4f;">
<b>Effective Activities</b><br>

1. Hands-On Coding Exercises – Writing the code directly during the lesson helped me understand how loops, conditionals, and buttons actually work in practice. It made the lessons more engaging and memorable.<br><br>

2. JavaScript Button Projects – Creating buttons that perform actions made me realize how HTML and JavaScript connect. This activity gave me instant results, which motivated me to learn more.<br><br>

<b>Not Effective Activities</b><br>

1. Sometimes I only copied what was on the board, but I didn’t fully understand how it worked. Without explanation, the activity felt less meaningful.<br><br>

2. Very Easy Coding Tasks – Some coding activities were too simple and didn’t really push me to think critically. While they were good for review, they did not give me much challenge.
